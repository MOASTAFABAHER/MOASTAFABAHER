<h3 align="left">1) TactiTrack</h3>

###

<p align="left">â€¢ TactiTrak is an AI-powered football analysis system that processes match footage to deliver advanced tactical<br>insights. It detects players, ball, referees, and goalkeepers using models like YOLO and ByteTrack, and classifies<br>players by team. The system features Zone Control, which divides the pitch into six zones and determines team<br>dominance in each based on player distribution. Additionally, Pass Line Detection identifies all available passing<br>options when a player is in possession, helping analyze decision-making and team positioning.<br>â€¢ TactiTrak is available as both a desktop and mobile application, offering flexibility for analysts, coaches, and fans to<br>use it in different environments.</p>
